# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

![Enrique's GitHub](./Assets/hero.png)

My name is Enrique, and I made a career change from industrial engineering to web and software development during the pandemic. I build and improve full stack applications, including mobile apps using Flutter! I'm working as a freelancer while I look for a full time position, so reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ehilst/) with any opportunities!
